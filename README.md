# ascending-up-Godot
This is a 2D platformer called 'Ascending Up' and is based on 'Only Up'. Made by Uttam in Godot 4.2 :D
W, A, D , Arrow keys to move.

Space bar, W, and up arrow to jump.

This is a Rage and speedrun-able(whatever it is said) game.

This game is made for the game jam SpeedJam 5 hosted by ScoreSpace.

This is my first game so don't hate and yes positive compliments and Game suggesions allowed.

Have a nice day :D.
